1. into_iter()
    - Receiver Argument: Takes in `self` (move ownership)
    - Returns: Returns IntoIter
    - Type of values produced by iterator: values for own type (i.e. T)
    - When to use: when you want to transfer ownership to another context

2. iter()
    - Receiver Argument: Takes in `&self` (borrow)
    - Returns: Returns Iter
    - Type of values produced by iterator: values of immutable reference for own type (i.e. &T)
    - When to use: when you want to iterate vector in read only mode

3. iter_mut()
    - Receiver Argument: Takes in `&mut self` (mutably borrow)
    - Returns: Returns IterMut
    - Type of values produced by iterator: values of mutable refercne for own type (i.e. &mut T)
    - When to use: when you want to itreate vector and change its value

4. drain(..)
    - Receiver Argument: Takes in `&mut self` (mutably borrow)
    - Returns: Returns Drain
    - Type of values produced by iterator: values for own type (i.e. T)
    - When to use: when you want to safely remove elements in range form vector then obtain the vector of removed elements
